# YOLO-Based-Pilot-Transfer-Safety-Detection
Computer visionâ€“based system using YOLO for detecting pilot transfer events between ladder and boat. Analyzes vessel relative motion to identify safe and unsafe jump windows in real time. Aims to improve maritime safety by supporting pilot decision-making during high-risk transfer operations.
